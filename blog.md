# Response to Johanna Drucker

 Hello,
My name is Justin Co and I have read your article “Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display” and all the points you made were very good and put some light on some many questions that some other digital humanities scholars had. When you are arguing that data is capta, and we take data rather than give was a really strong point that I also believe in as well. When we see data rather it be on the internet or any media platform, some might argue that the data is given to us, but I believe it’s taken. My argument to this would be that lots of stuff gives data to the viewer, but it is also the viewers choice rather to block all the data that is given to us, or take what information we feel is necessary for us. An example of this would be the argument you were making about data as capta using graphical displays. Most basic categories of in charts are “quantitative data” and the information its presenting itself are already interpreted expression. It does not give the viewer enough information for them to take the data. That is why The point you made about data is indeed capta is still an argued topic by many digital humanities scholars “By recognizing the always interpreted character of data we have shifted from data to capta, acknowledging the contructed-ness of the categories according to the uses and expectations for which they are put in service”(Drucker, Johanna). The way you describe graphs as ‘systematic expressions’ and that graphs are a reliable source to express information. Just like how Franco Moretti was arguing graphs can replace textual information “a field this large cannot be understood by stitching together separate bits of knowledge about individual cases, because it isn’t a sum of individual cases: it’s a collective system, that should be grasped as such,  as a whole—and the graphs that follow are one way to begin this.” (Moretti, Franco). But it is also argued that graphs have its limits as well, it only gives the user quantitative data which is data that is independent from interpretation. Graphs do infat give data but its up to us as the viewer to interpret that data and view it as data worth taken, hence, data is capta.

For the visual text analysis above, I decided to use Voyant and compare your article with Franco Morettis and I saw some similarities along with some differences. The similarities that I saw with comparing both articles is the use of the word ‘Novel’. Reading through some of Morettis article his is mostly on showing the rise and decline of novels with graphs, while you would discuss how the use of graphs can show different analysis and representations. The difference that I saw was how capta doesn’t seem to be visible on the visualization. Even though it is something you are arguing how many years later, it still strikes me odd that it doesn’t appear on the visualization.  


There is also a question that I have regarding the debate between close reading and distant reading. Do you think that distant reading could potentially take over close reading in the future? My answer would have to be yes and no. Although distant reading has some good points in trying to replace or even address a new way of analyzing data, close reading has been around for too long and offers enough information and context to the viewer that distant reading cant replace. Distant reading to me, is good for short term analysis or even when viewing art. Such as viewing a billboard/signs when driving or viewing art and analysing what it is trying to portray. But with closed reading, I believe you can analyze the text more thoroughly by taking different phrases, quotes and words and try to figure out what makes it so significant “Essentially, close reading means reading to uncover laters or meaning that lead to deep comprehension” (Janicke. S, Franzin. G, M.F. Cheema, Scheuermann. G. 2017).


When you discuss capta is “not an expression of idiosyncracy, emotion, or individual quirks, but a systematic expression” (Drucker, Johanna) and that it all depends on the persons ‘interpretation’ does that mean that the data that we take, we can believe that it is right, while others while interpret it as wrong? This point can be argued in many different ways, the first argument you can make is that the data that we have, we can interpret the data as either right or wrong. While the second argument is not everyone can interpret the same data identically. If I were to agree with one of those arguments, I would have to choose the first argument. In todays society everything is controlled by law, if you go against the rules of society, then you would be seen as in the wrong. But to argue that, you as a person are entitled to have your opinion of what is essentially right or wrong. If someone interprets the information as wrong, there will always be someone else to counter your opinion and describe what their perspective is.
