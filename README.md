# IASC 2P02 | Justin Co

## Bio

My name is Justin Co, I am 19 years old and I’m on my second year in the program Interactive arts and science at Brock University. My specific research area is media archeology, and my research program is understanding how old and new media affect each other. This research focus is reflected off projects such as the research presentation which shows how an old piece of media in the past inspired new media. This portfolio demonstrates my expertise in media technology by showing the extensive research on old media and being able to perform this type of research into a pecha kucha presentation. I will take this work in the future as a form of confidence and motivation to continue researching media archaeology and to further improve my presentation skills.

## Featured project : [Dr. Neubronner's Pigeon Camera] 
![](images/featured.jpg)

This project is my presentation that I have done about Dr Julius Neubronner and how he created pigeon photography. The presentation was created as a pecha kucha format which is originally 20 slides with 20 seconds each, but for this assignment it was reduced to 15 slides with 20 seconds each. The main purpose of this project was to do some research on any forgotten piece of media. For this project I had chosen Dr Julius Neubronners pigeon photography which was known to be the first form of aerial photography and is what inspired Google to map out the earth using satellite imagery. He had first used these to track where his pigeons would go, then it turned into something so useful that it was used in both world wars. But as time would go on and technology was becoming more innovative, his creation quickly faded, and he abandoned his experimentation. Although it was forgotten, it was the first creation of many to implement aerial photography. This would include creations such as Google maps/earth, crittercams, and drones. They were all inventions that took the simple forgotten idea of Neubronners pigeon photography, and put it into a new form, which is referred to as zombie media. 


The first commit I had done was this one [here](https://github.com/JustinCo13/IASC-2P02/commit/4bda4ed01e6573516886aa86215d3c6051fa8b1b) which I had changed my home page to put my link for my slides. I had put it there, so I could easily access my slides without typing a URL. The second commit was me changing the default pecha kucha format we had set up in class [here](https://github.com/JustinCo13/IASC-2P02/commit/6f691b405e61b21503d5a85139b6cdc89207aaa5). To do this I had to download the zip of my reveal folder and put it onto my desktop. This made it easier to edit because it lessened the time I could check my slides whenever I would make a change to the code. If I hadn’t put it on my desktop, each time I would make a change, this would take up to 5 minutes. I had then changed the background of the first image from teal to green [here](https://github.com/JustinCo13/IASC-2P02/commit/55d139fa416881a2ebedee9270e23b28ec7e944b). All of this was set up to after I had done my research, so I could easily paste in the pictures I wanted in the order I wanted. After this was finished, I then uploaded my final reveal folder into my GitHub frontpage [here](https://github.com/JustinCo13/IASC-2P02/commit/b4ed9885ef0e220d8633b1117bc1e7a137fc14f8). 


## Collaborative project

For this project we were split into teams to discuss a tool that is used in the humanities. The tool that me and my team chose was called “Humanities commons”. Humanities commons is an open-access open forum where anyone from the humanities, whether it be a student, professor or a scholar. It is open to everyone and is also non-profit. This makes it convenient for many students who are really interested in the humanities field. It allows them to connect with scholars and professors and learn a lot more. I can see this being used as a primary source/reference for assignments.

I had approached this assignment with the topic called MLA commons, but since the restrictions we had when trying to use the website, we had to change the topic from MLA commons to Humanities commons. I had to change the README.md in our team home page from MLA commons to Humanities commons shown [here](https://github.com/IascAtBrock/IASC-2P02-TeamPresentations/commit/cfecce9b1e613843f2a965152698393b139cd605). After changing that, I went to do my research on what the Humanities commons was [here](https://i.imgur.com/F4XelsL.jpg). I went on the home page of the website to see what the website was about and what more I can learn from it. It turns out that this was a large group consisting of many other commons organizations and we happened to do research on the humanities commons. With many other branches I searched up if they were getting funded from somewhere shown [here](https://i.imgur.com/Rf9bfG4.jpg). It showed me how they were able to get funding to create many other organizations. After the my part was finished I closed my personal issue [here](https://github.com/IascAtBrock/IASC-2P02-TeamPresentations/commit/4f6811aa8911d7b55480bcadac22e0b948456c02).


## Academic Blog
Johanna Drucker makes some strong arguements on Digital Humanities approach to Graphical Display.
I have my own opinions on her arguements as well and this is my response...[continue reading](https://justinco13.github.io/IASC-2P02/blog)
